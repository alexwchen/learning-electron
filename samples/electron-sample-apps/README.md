# Electron Sample Apps

This repository contains Electron sample apps to illustrate the usage of
[Electron APIs](https://github.com/atom/electron/tree/master/docs).

These sample apps are migrated from [nw-sample-apps](https://github.com/zcbenz/nw-sample-apps),
[chrome-app-sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples) and
[chromium extensions examples](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/&sq=package:chromium&type=cs).

All the sample test on v0.30.2.

## How to run apps

1. Install Electron via `npm install -g electron-prebuilt`.

2. Run the sample via `electron <electrom-sample-apps-path>/<sample-name>`.

If you want to know more about Electron app's development, please refer to the
